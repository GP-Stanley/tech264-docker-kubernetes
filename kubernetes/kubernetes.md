# Kubernetes
* Kubernetes is a powerful tool in the world of cloud computing and software development.

## Why is Kubernetes Needed?
* Kubernetes helps in managing containers, which are small, portable environments used to run applications. 
* Managing these containers manually can become difficult, especially as you scale up with more applications or users. 
* Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and operation of these containers, making it easier to manage complex applications across different servers.

## Benefits of Kubernetes
* **Scalability**: Automatically adjusts the number of containers based on application load, (provides load balancing).
* **Efficiency**: Helps you use resources (like CPU and memory) effectively, reducing costs.
* **Portability**: Applications can run in many different environments (e.g., on-premises, cloud).
* **High availability**: Keeps applications running even if some containers or servers fail.
* **Self-healing**: Automatically restarts or replaces failed containers.
* **Rollback**: Allows you to revert to a previous version of your application if something goes wrong with a new update, minimising downtime and keeping your users happy.
* **Open-source**: Being open-source, Kubernetes benefits from a large community of contributors who continuously improve and update the platform, ensuring it stays cutting-edge and reliable.
* **No single point of failure**: Distributes workloads across multiple nodes, ensuring that the failure of a single node does not bring down the entire application.

## Success Stories
* Many companies like Google, Spotify, and Shopify use Kubernetes to run applications at scale, manage high traffic, and quickly deploy new features. 
* Itâ€™s particularly popular among companies that rely on microservices architectures, where applications are split into smaller, manageable parts.

### Spotify
* **Challenge**: Spotify, a global audio-streaming platform, needed to manage its rapidly growing user base and complex microservices architecture. 
  * Initially, they used a homegrown container orchestration system called Helios, but it became clear that they needed a more robust solution supported by a larger community.

* **Solution**: Spotify decided to migrate to Kubernetes. 
  * They were attracted by Kubernetes' feature-rich environment and the strong community support. 
  * The migration allowed Spotify to benefit from increased velocity, reduced costs, and alignment with industry best practices.

Impact:
* **Improved Efficiency**: Teams could focus more on delivering features rather than managing infrastructure.
* **Autoscaling**: Kubernetes' autoscaling capabilities allowed Spotify to handle up to 10 million requests per second efficiently.
* **Reduced Provisioning Time**: Creating new services and getting them operational in production went from taking an hour to just seconds or minutes.
* **Better Resource Utilisation**: Kubernetes' bin-packing and multi-tenancy features improved CPU utilisation by two to three times.

> Spotify's successful migration to Kubernetes highlights how the platform can handle complex, large-scale applications, improve operational efficiency, and support rapid growth. This success story demonstrates the transformative power of Kubernetes in modern application management.


<br>

# Kubernetes Architecture
* Kubernetes uses a cluster setup, which is a group of connected computers (nodes) that work together.
  * **Master Node**: The brain of the cluster, controlling and managing tasks, distributing them to worker nodes.
  * **Worker Nodes**: Execute the tasks assigned by the master node by running containers.

Diagram: A simple structure of a Kubernetes architecture:

          +---------------+            +--------------------+
          |               |            |                    |
          |   Master      | ----->     | Worker Nodes       |
          |               |            |                    |
          +---------------+            +--------------------+

# Kubernetes terminology and architecture

<br>

## Pods
* A Kubernetes pod is a group of containers that work together and share the same resources like memory and storage. 
* Each pod has one IP address that all its containers use. 
* This setup makes it easy to manage the containers as a single application.
  * **Single Container Pods**: Often, a pod has just one container, especially if the application is simple.
  * **Multi-Container Pods**: For more complex tasks, a pod can have multiple containers that share data and work together.

Example: Imagine you have a service that creates GIFs. One pod might have several containers:
* One container handles incoming requests.
* Other containers process images in the background.

This setup helps manage the application efficiently and ensures all parts work together smoothly.

![pod-arch](./kube-images/pod-arch.png)

<br>

## Deployments
* Kubernetes deployments *define the scale* at which you want to run your application by letting you set the details of *how you would like pods replicated* on your Kubernetes nodes. 
* Deployments describe the **number of desired identical pod replicas to run** and the preferred update *strategy used when updating* the deployment. 
* Kubernetes will **track pod health**, and will **remove or add pods** as needed to bring your application deployment to the **desired state**.

![deploy](./kube-images/deploy.png)

<br>

## Services
* In Kubernetes, the lifetime of an individual pod is unpredictable; their **IP addresses** and **existence** can **change**. 
* In the DevOps world, servers are often treated as either "pets" (cared for individually) or "cattle" (*interchangeable*). 
* Kubernetes treats its pods like cattle, **replacing them if they fail** to ensure the application keeps running smoothly.

![alt text](./kube-images/cat-pets.png)

* A **service** in Kubernetes is an abstraction that provides a **stable interface for interacting with pods**. 
* As pods are **replaced**, their **names** and **IPs** might **change**, but the **service maintains a consistent machine name or IP address**. 
  * This way, to the outside network, everything appears unchanged, even as the underlying pods are updated or replaced.

<br>

## Nodes
* A Kubernetes node **manages** and **runs pods**; itâ€™s the **machine** (whether virtualised or physical) that **performs the given work**. 
* Just as **pods collect individual containers that operate together**, a **node collects entire pods that function together**. 
* When youâ€™re operating at scale, you want to be able to hand work over to a node whose pods are free to take it.

<br>

## The Kubernetes control plane
* The Kubernetes control plane is the **main entry point** for **administrators** and **users** to **manage the various nodes**. 
* Operations are issued to it either through HTTP calls or connecting to the machine and running command-line scripts. 
* As the name implies, it **controls how Kubernetes interacts with your applications**.

<br>

# What is a Cluster?
* A cluster in computing is like a team of computers working together to achieve a common goal. 
* Each computer in the cluster is called a node, and they all communicate and collaborate to run applications more efficiently and reliably.
* It allows multiple computers to work together seamlessly, providing better performance, scalability, and reliability for running applications

## Key Components of a Kubernetes Cluster
Master Node:
* **Control Plane**: This is the brain of the cluster. It manages the cluster, schedules applications, and handles the overall state of the system.
* **API Server**: Acts as the front end for the Kubernetes control plane. It exposes the Kubernetes API.
* **Scheduler**: Assigns work to the worker nodes based on resource availability.
* **Controller Manager**: Ensures the desired state of the cluster matches the actual state.
* **etcd**: A key-value store that holds all the data about the cluster's state.

Worker Nodes:
* **Kubelet**: An agent that runs on each worker node and ensures containers are running in a pod.
* **Kube-proxy**: Manages network communication inside and outside the cluster.
* **Container Runtime**: Software that runs the containers, such as Docker or containerd.

<br>

## Cluster Architecture/Diagram
* A cluster is all of the below components put together as a single unit.

![control-plane](./kube-images/control-plane.png)

Source: https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/kubernetes-control-plane-monitoring-overview

<br>

# Control Plane

## Controller manager
* The controller-manager is responsible for making sure that the **shared state of the cluster is operating as expected**. 
* More accurately, the controller manager **oversees various controllers which respond to events** (e.g., if a node goes down)

## API Server
* The API server exposes a **REST interface** to the Kubernetes cluster. 
* All **operations** against pods, services, and so forth, are **executed programmatically by communicating with the endpoints provided by it**.

## Scheduler
* The scheduler is responsible for **assigning work** to the various nodes. 
* It keeps watch over the resource capacity and **ensures that a worker nodeâ€™s performance is within an appropriate threshold**.

## etcd
`etcd`

* is a distributed key-value store that Kubernetes uses to share information about the overall state of a cluster. 
* Additionally, nodes can refer to the global configuration data stored there to set themselves up whenever they are regenerated.

<br>

# Worker node components

## Kubelet
* A Kubelet tracks the state of a pod to ensure that all the containers are running. 
* It provides a heartbeat message every few seconds to the control plane. 
* If a replication controller does not receive that message, the node is marked as unhealthy.

## Kube proxy
* The Kube proxy routes traffic coming into a node from the service. 
* It forwards requests for work to the correct containers.

## Container runtime
* This is responsible for working with the containers and executing them. 
* It can be Docker or another container runtime, such as containerd or cri-o.
* It uses the container runtime interface (CRI) to communicate with the kubelet.

## Pods
* These are groups of one or more containers that share storage and network resources, and a specification for how to run them. 
* Pods are the smallest units of a Kubernetes application. 
* They can be created and managed by workload resources, such as deployments or statefulsets. 

![alt text](./kube-images/work-node.png)

<br>

# The Cluster Setup
* A cluster is the basic setup for Kubernetes, where multiple computers work together as a single unit. The main parts are master nodes and worker nodes:
  * **Master Node**: Responsible for controlling and scheduling tasks within the cluster. It houses the control plane, where all the decision-making happens.
  * **Worker Nodes**: Run the application workloads and communicate with the master node.

<br>

## Master vs Worker Nodes
In a cluster, there are two main types of nodes: master nodes and worker nodes.

Master Nodes:
* These are the brains of the cluster. 
* They manage and control everything that happens in the cluster. 
* The master nodes decide which tasks need to be done and assign those tasks to the worker nodes. 
* They also keep track of the overall health and status of the cluster.

Worker Nodes:
* These are the hands of the cluster. 
* They do the actual work assigned by the master nodes. 
* Each worker node runs applications and handles tasks like processing data, responding to user requests, and more. 
* Worker nodes report back to the master nodes to let them know how things are going.

> Summary
> 
> **Cluster**: A group of connected computers working together.
> 
> **Master Nodes**: Manage and control the cluster, assigning tasks to worker nodes. On average you'll want a minimum of 3. 
> 
> **Worker Nodes**: Perform the tasks assigned by the master nodes, running applications and handling workloads.

<br>

## Managed Service vs. Launching Your Own
* **Managed Service** (like Google Kubernetes Engine, Amazon EKS): 
  * Easier to set up and maintain, as the provider handles many aspects, like updates and scaling.
* **Self-Managed**: Offers full control but requires more expertise and management.

### Pros of Managed Service
* Reduces the time and effort needed to set up and maintain Kubernetes.
* Automatic updates and security patches.
* **Azure Kubernetes Service** (AKS): Simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure by offloading the operational overhead to Azure. 
  * Azure handles critical tasks like health monitoring and maintenance.

### Cons of Managed Service
* Limited customisation.
* Potentially higher costs.

<br>

## Launching Your Own
Launching your own Kubernetes service means setting up and managing your Kubernetes cluster independently, without relying on a managed service provider like Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon EKS, or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

### Pros of Launching Your Own
* **Full Control**: You have complete control over the configuration and management of your Kubernetes cluster.
  * You can customise the setup to meet specific requirements and preferences.

* **Cost Efficiency**: Potentially lower costs if you have the expertise and resources to manage the infrastructure efficiently.
  * Avoids the premium costs associated with managed services.

* **Flexibility**: You can choose your own hardware, cloud provider, or hybrid setup.
  * Freedom to use any Kubernetes-compatible tools and integrations.

* **Security**: You can implement custom security measures and policies tailored to your organisation's needs.
  * Full control over data privacy and compliance.

* **Learning and Expertise**: Provides an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and expertise in Kubernetes and container orchestration.
  * Valuable for teams looking to build and maintain their own infrastructure skills.

### Cons of Launching Your Own
* **Complexity**: Setting up and managing a Kubernetes cluster can be complex and time-consuming.
  * Requires a deep understanding of Kubernetes architecture and best practices.

* **Maintenance**: You are responsible for all maintenance tasks, including updates, patches, and scaling.
  * Ongoing monitoring and troubleshooting can be resource-intensive.

* **Resource Requirements**: Requires significant resources, including skilled personnel and hardware.
  * May need to invest in additional tools for monitoring, logging, and security.

* **Risk of Downtime**: Higher risk of downtime if not managed properly.
  * Requires robust disaster recovery and backup plans.

* **Support**: Limited to community support unless you invest in third-party support services.
  * May lack the immediate assistance available with managed services.


## Control Plane (Master Node) vs. Data Plane (Worker Node)
The master node works on the control plane, and the worker nodes work on the data plane. 
* **Control Plane**: The brains of the cluster, handling the scheduling, monitoring, and scaling of applications.
* **Data Plane**: Executes tasks and runs the application workloads on worker nodes.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Specifics
Control Plane
* Azure automatically creates and configures the control plane for you at no cost. 
* The Azure platform manages the AKS control plane, which is responsible for the Kubernetes objects and worker nodes that you deploy to run your applications.

Data Plane
* The data plane consists of the worker nodes, which are Azure virtual machines (VMs) that run your applications. 
* You only pay for the AKS nodes that run your applications.

> By using AKS, you benefit from a fully managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerised applications, allowing you to focus more on your applications and less on the underlying infrastructure.

<br>

# Kubernetes Objects
* Kubernetes manages several types of objects that define different parts of an application.
  * **Deployments**: Control how and where Pods are run, making it easy to roll out updates.
  * **ReplicaSets**: Ensure a specified number of identical Pods are running.
  * **Pods**: The smallest deployable unit, containing one or more containers.

![alt text](./kube-images/objects.png)

<br>

# ReplicaSets
A ReplicaSet in Kubernetes is like a manager that ensures you always have a certain number of identical workers (called Pods) running at all times. 

* **Pods**: Think of Pods as individual workers that do a specific job in your application.
* **ReplicaSet**: The manager that keeps an eye on these workers.

## How It Works:
* **Desired Number**: You tell the ReplicaSet how many Pods you want running. For example, you might say, "I need 3 Pods running."
* **Monitoring**: The ReplicaSet constantly monitors the Pods to make sure the desired number is running.
* **Replacement**: If one of the Pods fails or stops working, the ReplicaSet will automatically create a new Pod to replace it, ensuring you always have the specified number of Pods running.

> a ReplicaSet helps maintain the stability and reliability of your application by ensuring that the right number of Pods are always up and running.

## Example
* Imagine you have a web application, and you want to make sure there are always 3 instances of it running to handle user requests. 
* You create a ReplicaSet and set the desired number of Pods to 3. 
* If one of the instances crashes, the ReplicaSet will notice and start a new instance to replace it, keeping your application running smoothly.

<br>

# Pods
* A pod in Kubernetes is the smallest and simplest unit that you can create or deploy. 
  * Think of it as a tiny, self-contained environment where your application runs.

## Key Points
### Group of Containers
* A pod can contain one or more containers that share the same resources like memory and storage. 
* These containers work together as a single application.

### Shared IP Address
* All containers within a pod share the same IP address, which makes it easy for them to communicate with each other.

### Ephemeral
* Pods are temporary and can be created, destroyed, and replaced as needed. 
* If a pod fails, Kubernetes can automatically create a new one to replace it.

## What Does It Mean When a Pod is "Ephemeral"?
* Pods are ephemeral, meaning they are *temporary*. 
* If a Pod fails or is no longer needed, Kubernetes will terminate it and create a new one when necessary.

<br>

# What is a Volume?
* A way to store the data for the pods.
* A volume is a storage resource that is accessible to all containers within a pod. 
* Unlike the ephemeral storage that containers use by default (which is lost when the container stops), volumes provide a way to persist data beyond the lifecycle of individual containers.

## Key Points
### Persistent Storage
* Volumes allow data to be stored persistently, so it remains available even if the container restarts or the pod is rescheduled to a different node.

### Shared Storage
* All containers within a pod can access the same volume, making it easy to share data between them.

### Types of Volumes
* Kubernetes supports various types of volumes, such as emptyDir, hostPath, persistentVolumeClaim, configMap, and more. 
* Each type serves different use cases and storage needs.

<br>

# Secrets in Kubernetes
Secrets are encoded with base64 but this is not the same as being encrypted. 
* Secrets in Kubernetes are used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, and keys. 
* While they are encoded with base64, this encoding is not the same as encryption. 
* **Base64** encoding is simply a way to represent binary data in an ASCII string format, making it easier to handle and transmit. 
  * However, it does not provide any security or protection for the data.

## Key Points
### Base64 Encoding
* Converts binary data into a text format using a set of 64 characters. 
* This makes it easier to store and transmit data but does not secure it.

### Encryption
* Involves transforming data into a secure format that can only be read by someone with the correct decryption key. 
* This provides a higher level of security compared to base64 encoding.

## Best Practices for Securing Secrets
* **Use Encryption**: Store secrets in an encrypted format to protect them from unauthorised access.
* **Limit Access**: Restrict access to secrets to only those components and users that absolutely need it.
* **Use External Secret Management Tools**: Consider using tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to manage and secure secrets outside of Kubernetes.
* **Audit and Monitor**: Regularly audit and monitor access to secrets to detect and respond to any unauthorised access.

<br>

# Name Space
* A logical way to group your resources for an application within a cluster. 
  * Think of it as a virtual boundary that helps you manage and isolate different parts of your application or different environments (like development, testing, and production).

## Key Points
* **Logical Grouping**: Namespaces allow you to group resources (like pods, services, and deployments) for an application, making it easier to manage and organise them.
* **Isolation**: They provide a level of isolation between different projects or teams, ensuring that resources in one namespace do not interfere with resources in another.
* **Default Namespace**: If you don't specify a namespace when creating a resource, it will be placed in the default namespace.

<br>

# Mitigating Security Concerns with Containers
Containers can be vulnerable, so itâ€™s important to:
* Use maintained images (updated by trusted sources).
* Limit container permissions.
* Use security tools for scanning and monitoring containers.

## How to mitigate security concerns with containers
* **No Root Privliges**: NEVER run containers with root privileges. 
  * Running containers as root can expose your system to significant security risks. 
  * Always use the principle of least privilege.
* **Monitoring and logging**: Implement monitoring and logging of container activity. 
  * This helps detect and respond to suspicious behavior or potential security incidents in real-time. 
* **Image Scanning**: Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair, Trivy, or Aqua Security. 
  * This helps identify and fix security issues before deploying your containers.
* **Network Policies**: Implement network policies to control traffic between pods. 
  * This minimises the attack surface by restricting which pods can communicate with each other.
* **Role-Based Access Control** (RBAC): Define and control permissions within the cluster using RBAC. 
  * This ensures that only authorised users and services can access and modify resources.
* **Namespace Isolation**: Use namespaces to separate environments within the cluster for different applications or teams. 
  * This provides an additional layer of isolation and security.
* **Use Trusted Sources**: Only deploy images from reliable and secure repositories. 
  * Using maintained images from trusted sources ensures that your containers receive regular updates and security patches.

<br>

## Maintained Images
* Maintained images are container images created and updated by a trusted source, like Docker or a cloud provider. 
* They come with frequent updates, security patches, and optimisations.

## Key Points
* **Frequent Updates**: Maintained images receive regular updates to fix bugs, improve performance, and patch security vulnerabilities.
* **Trusted Sources**: These images are provided by reputable organizations, ensuring a higher level of trust and reliability.

### Pros
* **Saves Time and Effort**: Updates and patches are handled for you, reducing the time and effort needed to maintain the images.
* **Security**: Generally more secure than unmaintained images, as they receive regular security patches and updates.
* **Reliability**: Maintained images are usually tested and optimized for stability and performance, reducing the likelihood of encountering issues.
* **Community Support**: Maintained images often come with extensive documentation and community support, making it easier to troubleshoot and resolve issues.
* **Compliance**: These images are often compliant with industry standards and regulations, which can be crucial for certain applications.

### Cons
* **Limited Customisation**: May not have all the customization options you need for specific use cases.
* **Larger Size**: Could be larger in size than a custom-built image, potentially using more resources.
* **Dependency on External Updates**: Relying on external maintainers for timely updates could be risky if updates are delayed.
* **Potential Bloat**: Maintained images might include unnecessary components that you don't need, which can increase the image size and resource usage.
* **Compatibility Issues**: Sometimes, updates to maintained images can introduce compatibility issues with your existing setup, requiring additional testing and adjustments.

> Kubernetes is a powerful way to manage applications efficiently and reliably at scale. With practice, the architecture and terms will become more familiar, helping you leverage all the benefits Kubernetes has to offer.

## Create a Node Port Service for Nginx
Three main services:
* **A Node Port**: easiest way to expose pods to the outsidw world through a port. 
  * NodePort service can use 30000-32768
* **Cluser IP**:The default type of service, which exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. 
  * This means the service is only accessible within the cluster.
* **Load Balancer Service**: Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. 
  * This is useful for distributing traffic across multiple pods and ensuring high availability.

<br>

* Create a new definition file within 'local-nginx-deploy' folder. 
  * `nano nginx-service.yml`

```yaml
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-svc
  namespace: default
spec:
  ports:
  - nodePort: 30001	# range is 30000-32768
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx	# this label to match service to deployment
  type: NodePort
```

* Run the file.
  * `kubectl create -f nginx-service.yml`
* Check it's been created.
  * `kubectl get services`

![alt text](./kube-images/image-5.png)

* Go to your local browser: localhost:30001 (this is because we have 30001 under port(s))
  * This means you've connected to one of your pods. 

![alt text](./kube-images/image-6.png)

<br>

## Deleting a Pod
* View your pods.
  * `kubectl get pods`

* Delete one of these.
  * `kubectl delete pod nginx-deployment-77897d64b4-7r828`

Why has it been replaced?
* Because it's self healing. 

![alt text](./kube-images/image-7.png)

<br> 

## Increase Number of Replicas

1. We can directly edit the deployment in real time. 
   * Use this command to search for the deployment: `kubectl get all`
   * We can use: `kubectl edit deploy nginx-deployment`
   * Change your "replicas" from 3 to 4.
   * Save and exit.

![alt text](./kube-images/image-8.png)

* Check if it's changed:
  * `kubectl get all`

<br>

2. Modify deployment file and apply it.
   * `nano nginx-deploy.yml`: change 3 to 5.
   * `kubectl get all`: we need to apply these changes. 
   * Create and update configs using a yaml definition:
     * `kubectl apply -f nginx-deploy.yml`

![alt text](./kube-images/image-9.png)

* `kubectl get all`
  * Now you can see that there are 5 pods!

![alt text](./kube-images/image-10.png)

<br> 

3. Use a command to increase the number of replica pods.
   * Have the number of replicas available (i.e.,5).
   * `kubectl scale --current-replicas=5 --replicas=6 deployment.apps/nginx-deployment`
   * Check: `kubectl get all`

![alt text](./kube-images/image-11.png)

<br>

## How to Delete Everything
It's best practise to delete things in a logical order: deploy, then service. 
* `kubectl delete -f <yaml.file>`
  * `kubectl delete -f nginx-service.yml`
  * `kubectl delete -f nginx-deploy.yml`

![alt text](./kube-images/image-12.png)

* The 'delete' deletes the objects but not the yaml files.

# My Interpretation of Kubernetes Architecture

![alt text](./kube-images/image-15.png)

<br>

# K8s deployment of NodeJS Sparta test app
Pre-Requisites:
* Docker image for the NodeJS Sparta test app: gina98/sparta-test-app:v1
* Database container Docker image: mongo:7.0.6

Guidance:
* Before you do it, draw a K8s architecture diagram and share it
* Copy the YAML files we already used to a new folder for this deployment, but change the file names, label/tags, images used, ports
* Deploy the app (3 replicas) without the database first, then
* Make a another deployment folder that also includes the Mongo database (1 replica)

<br>

## Create Deployment for mongodb-deploy.yml
Create a yaml file called [mongo-deploy.yml](../k8s-yaml-definitions/local-nginx-deploy/mongodb-deploy.yml). This YAML script defines a Kubernetes Deployment for a MongoDB instance. 

### Explanation

2. **kind**: Specifies the kind of Kubernetes object to create. In this case, it's a `Deployment`.
3. **metadata**: Provides metadata for the deployment, including the name of the deployment (`mongodb-deployment`).
4. **spec**: Defines the specification for the deployment, including the following:
   * **selector**: Specifies the label selector to match the pods managed by this deployment. In this case, it looks for pods with the label `app: mongodb`.
   * **replicas**: Specifies the number of pod replicas to create. In this case, it creates 1 replica.
   * **template**: Defines the pod template used to create the pods. This includes:
     * **metadata**: Provides metadata for the pods, including the label `app: mongodb`.
     * **spec**: Defines the specification for the pods, including the following:
       * **containers**: Specifies the containers to run in the pods. In this case, it runs a single container with the following properties:
       * **name**: The name of the container (`mongodb`).
       * **image**: The Docker image to use for the container (`mongo:7.0.6`).
       * **ports**: Specifies the ports to expose. In this case, it exposes port `27017`.

> This script creates a Kubernetes Deployment that manages a single replica of a MongoDB pod using the mongo:7.0.6 Docker image. The pod is labeled with app: mongodb and exposes port 27017 for MongoDB connections.

<br>

## Create a Service for MongoDB
Create a yaml file called [mondobg-service](../k8s-yaml-definitions/local-nginx-deploy/mongodb-service.yml). This YAML script defines a Kubernetes Service for a MongoDB instance.

### Explanation
1. **apiVersion**: Specifies the API version to use for the service. In this case, it's `v1`.
2. **kind**: Specifies the kind of Kubernetes object to create. In this case, it's a `Service`.
3. **metadata**: Provides metadata for the service, including the name of the service (`mongodb-svc`) and the namespace (`default`).
4. **spec**: Defines the specification for the service, including the following:
   * **ports**: Specifies the ports to expose. In this case:
     * **nodePort**: `30002` - The port on each node where the service is exposed.
     * **port**: `27017` - The port that the service listens on.
     * **targetPort**: `27017` - The port on the pod that the service forwards traffic to.
   * **selector**: Specifies the label selector to match the pods managed by this service. In this case, it looks for pods with the label `app: mongodb`.
   * **type**: Specifies the type of service. In this case, it's a `NodePort` service, which exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP.

> This script creates a Kubernetes Service that exposes the MongoDB instance running in the `default` namespace. The service listens on port `27017` and is accessible via the node port `30002`. The service forwards traffic to pods with the label `app: mongodb`.

<br>

## Create Deployment YAML for NodeJS App

         * **command**: Specifies the shell to use (`/bin/sh`) with the `-c` option to run the command provided in the `args` section.
         * **args**: Executes the following commands:
           * `cd ../app`: Changes the directory to the parent directory and then into the "app" folder.
           * `node seeds/seed.js`: Runs the Node.js script to seed the database.
           * `npm start`: Starts the application using npm.

> This script creates a Kubernetes Deployment that manages three replicas of a Sparta application pod using the gina98/sparta-test-app:v1 Docker image. The pods are labeled with app: sparta-app, expose port 3000, set the DB_HOST environment variable, and run the seed script to initialize the database before starting the application.

<br>

## Create App Service
Create a yaml file called [nodejs-service.yml](../k8s-yaml-definitions/local-nginx-deploy/nodejs-service.yml). This YAML script defines a Kubernetes Service for your Sparta application.

### Explanation
1. **apiVersion**: Specifies the API version to use for the service. In this case, it's `v1`.
2. **kind**: Specifies the kind of Kubernetes object to create. In this case, it's a `Service`.
3. **metadata**: Provides metadata for the service, including the name of the service (`sparta-app-svc`) and the namespace (`default`).
4. **spec**: Defines the specification for the service, including the following:
   * **ports**: Specifies the ports to expose. In this case:
     * **nodePort**: `30003` - The port on each node where the service is exposed.
     * **port**: `80` - The port that the service listens on.
     * **targetPort**: `3000` - The port on the pod that the service forwards traffic to.
   * **selector**: Specifies the label selector to match the pods managed by this service. In this case, it looks for pods with the label `app: sparta-app`.
   * **type**: Specifies the type of service. In this case, it's a `NodePort` service, which exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP.

> This script creates a Kubernetes Service that exposes the Sparta application running in the default namespace. The service listens on port 80 and is accessible via the node port 30003. The service forwards traffic to pods with the label app: sparta-app and directs it to port 3000 on those pods.

<br>

## Run and Verify the Deployment
Run these Kubernetes commands: 
* `kubectl create -f mongodb-deploy.yml`
* `kubectl create -f mongodb-service.yml`
* `kubectl create -f nodejs-deploy.yml`
* `kubectl create -f  nodejs-service.yml`

![alt text](./kube-images/image-14.png)
![alt text](./kube-images/image-13.png)

* `kubectl get pods`: to check the status of your pods and ensure they are running.
* `kubectl get services`: to verify that your services are correctly configured and accessible.
* `kubectl get all`: to get all of the information in one. 

### Blockers
* In your app-service.yml when connecting with the database you need to change the NodePort and it can't be the same port as the db-service.yml.
* Make sure you create the db-deploy.yml and db-service.yml as the app needs something to connect to.

<br>

## Deletion Commands
* `kubectl delete service mongodb-svc`
* `kubectl delete service sparta-app-svc` 
* `kubectl delete deployment mongodb-deployment`
* `kubectl delete deployment sparta-app-deployment`

## Creation Commands
* `kubectl create -f mongodb-deploy.yml`
* `kubectl create -f mongodb-service.yml`
* `kubectl create -f nodejs-deploy.yml`
* `kubectl create -f nodejs-service.yml`

## Check They're There
* `kubectl get all`

<br>

## Seeding the Database
* This will need to be inputted after the environment variable within 'nodejs-deploy.yml' file.

### Copy the app folder
Path for app folder:
* C:\Users\georg\OneDrive - Sparta Global\Documents\tech264-docker-app-container\app\seeds

Copy your app folder to your k8s-yaml-definitions folder (the parent directory to the local-nginx-deploy').
* Navigate to wherever your app folder is kept.
* Use the copy command:
  * `cp -r ~/OneDrive\ -\ Sparta\ Global/Documents/tech264-docker-app-container/app ~/OneDrive\ -\ Sparta\ Global/Documents/GitHub\ Repos/tech264-docker-kubernetes/k8s-yaml-definitions/`

![alt text](./kube-images/image-16.png)

<br>

Navigate to the [nodejs-deploy.yml](../k8s-yaml-definitions/local-nginx-deploy/nodejs-deploy.yml) file and add the command to seed your database. 

```yaml
        env:
        - name: DB_HOST
          value: "mongodb://mongodb-svc.default.svc.cluster.local:27017/posts"
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        args: ["cd ../app && node seeds/seed.js && npm start"]
```

![alt text](./kube-images/image-17.png)

<br>

### Explanation
**Environment Variable** (`env`):
* **name**: `DB_HOST` - This is the name of the environment variable.
* **value**: `"mongodb://mongodb-svc.default.svc.cluster.local:27017/posts"`
  * This is the value assigned to the `DB_HOST` variable, which points to the MongoDB service running in the Kubernetes cluster at the specified address and port.

> When your application container starts, it will use this environment variable to connect to the MongoDB database at the given address. This allows your application to interact with the database without hardcoding the database URL in your application code.

**Command** (`command`):
* `command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]`
* This specifies the shell to use for executing the command. 
* In this case, it uses the `/bin/sh` shell with the `-c` option to run the command provided in the args section.

**Arguments** (args):
* `args: ["cd ../app && node seeds/seed.js && npm start"]`
  * This specifies the command to be executed by the shell. 
  * It performs the following actions:
  * `cd ../app`: Changes the directory to the parent directory and then into the "app" folder.
  * `node seeds/seed.js`: Runs the Node.js script to seed the database.
  * `npm start`: Starts the application using npm.
